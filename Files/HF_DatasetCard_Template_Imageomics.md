As with your GitHub Project repo, it is important to choose an appropriate license for your dataset. The default license is [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (public domain dedication, see [Dryad's explanation of why to use CC0](https://blog.datadryad.org/2023/05/30/good-data-practices-removing-barriers-to-data-reuse-with-cc0-licensing/)). Alongside the appropriate stakeholders (eg., your PI, co-authors), select a license that is [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses) (OSI) compliant.
For more information on how to choose a license and why it matters, see [Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com) and [A Quick Guide to Software Licensing for the Scientist-Programmer](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002598) by A. Morin, et al.
